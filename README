## Epigenome


#files were obtained using wget within the relevant data directory
wget -i sources.H3K4me3


#folders for output were created 


####### Attempt 1: binCOunts from BigWig files.
# bigWig (.bw) files were created using wigToBigWig
batchCreateBws.sh -> createBwOnFiles.sh
#bin counts were made using
batchBinCounts.sh -> binCountOnFileBase.sh  -> GetBinsFromBed.pl
# took 30 hours for chr11. 
# NOT RECOMENDED:-
	# slow. 
	# inaccurate (fixed width wig files do not store co-ordinates of reads only bins)
	# may be useful if need data from around specific points e.g. TSS
	# perhaps use featureBits instead

###### Attempt 2: regular interval binCounts from Bed
# starting .bed.gz files are much larger (~1.5Gb uncompressed)
# beds must be sorted (beware +/- strands in bed files.)

# download files as above

# copy and uncompress
# split to separate chroms and sort each
batchSplitBedGzToBedByChr.sh -> splitBedOnChr.sh
# N.B. could use Kent: bedSplitOnChrom


# run bincounting on each chrom
batchBinCountsRegFromBed.sh -> binCountRegFromBed.sh -> countBedToRegBins.pl

# re-combine individual chrom results?
batchCatChromFilesInDir.sh -> catChromFilesInDir.sh

# bind count results across samples
bindGenomeBins.R


#N.B. bedSort does not order chromosomes.

## Comparing two sets of binCounts.
